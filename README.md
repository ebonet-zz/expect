# goexpect

Small assertion library to work with go native testing. This is not intended to be a testing framework, just some "syntax sugar".

There are other libraries that do something similar (such as https://github.com/stretchr/testify), but I wanted something very simple and very minimalistic. These are just methods I actually use when testing, and I'll be adding more if I feel the need for it.

## Methods

* Condition
* Equal
* Between
* Aproximate
* Err
* NoErr
